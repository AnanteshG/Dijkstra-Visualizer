# Dijkstra-Visualizer

This Python script provides a visual representation of Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph. It allows users to input the number of nodes, specify the nodes, input the edges with weights, and choose a starting node. The script then visualizes the shortest distances and paths from the chosen starting node using networkx and matplotlib.

## Running the code
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
```

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnanteshG/Dijkstra-Visualizer.git
cd your-repository
```

### Navigate to Repository Directory
```bash
cd your-repository
```

### Run the script
```bash
python dijkstra_visualizer.py
```

### Input Graph details
Follow the on-screen prompts to input the graph details:

-Enter the number of nodes
-Specify the name of each node
-Enter the number of edges
-Provide edge details in the format: source, destination, value

### Choose a starting node
Enter the starting node for Dijkstra's algorithm when prompted.
The script will then visualize the process and display the shortest distances and paths from the chosen starting node.
